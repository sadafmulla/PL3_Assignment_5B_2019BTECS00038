        <strong>What is Blockchain?</strong>
        <br>
        The term “blockchain” is made up of two words “block” and “chain”. We can define blockchain as a chain of blocks
        containing information. Blockchain timestamps digital documents so it is impossible to tamper with them or
        change their date. The primary goal of blockchain is to solve the problem of keeping double records without
        requiring a central server.

    <strong>The Truth About Blockchain</strong>
    <br>Contracts, transactions, and the records of them are among the defining structures in our economic, legal, and
    political systems. They protect assets and set organizational boundaries. They establish and verify identities and
    chronicle events. They govern interactions among nations, organizations, communities, and individuals. They guide
    managerial and social action. And yet these critical tools and the bureaucracies formed to manage them have not kept
    up with the economy’s digital transformation. They’re like a rush-hour gridlock trapping a Formula 1 race car. In a
    digital world, the way we regulate and maintain administrative control has to change.
<br>

    <br><strong> Patterns of Technology Adoption</strong>
    <br>Before jumping into blockchain strategy and investment, let’s reflect on what we know about technology adoption
    and, in particular, the transformation process typical of other foundational technologies. One of the most relevant
    examples is distributed computer networking technology, seen in the adoption of TCP/IP (transmission control
    protocol/internet protocol), which laid the groundwork for the development of the internet.

    <br><strong> Importance of Blockchain</strong>
    <br>Blockchain as a data storage opportunity can generate immense benefits for organisations in manufacturing,
    healthcare, and education. According to Gartner’s 2019 CIO Survey, 2% of higher education institutions had already
    deployed blockchain while 18% planned to do it in the next 24 months.

    This industry acceptance speaks of the many advantages that blockchain brings to the table, including:

    Transparency;
    Security;
    Reduced costs;
    Traceability;
    Speed and efficiency.
    Universities, schools, startups, and nonprofits can adopt blockchain solutions to enhance the efficiency of student
    data management and create better ways to engage learners. Additionally, blockchain allows external stakeholders
    like employers to assess the validity of students’ skills.
